      "reasoning": "The agent followed a reasonable, data-driven approach: it located the Paradigm Health organization ID, queried the deals for that organization, and joined on institutional_investments and articles to extract round, date, lead investors, and article links — matching the expected method. The answer includes the required fields for each round (round name, date, valuation status, lead investor(s), and article URL) and correctly reports that valuation figures are not present in the dataset for these rounds. The reported round sizes ($203M Series A and $78M Series B), lead investors (ARCH Venture Partners and General Catalyst for Series A; ARCH for Series B), and article sources (Finsmes and PR Newswire links) are consistent with the example and likely dataset values. Efficiency was also good: the agent used three tool calls (within the expected ≤3). Overall the result is defensible, complete, and efficient; minor differences in exact date formatting or choosing the dataset's primary article link do not undermine correctness.",

Here are all recorded funding rounds and the fields you requested:\n\n- Series A — 2023-01-30  \n  - Valuation: undisclosed / not recorded in dataset  \n  - Lead investor(s): General Catalyst; ARCH Venture Partners  \n  - Article (primary): https://www.finsmes.com/2023/01/paradigm-raises-203m-in-series-a-funding.html  \n  - Round size (from dataset): $203.0M\n\n- Series B — 2025-12-04  \n  - Valuation: undisclosed / not recorded in dataset  \n  - Lead investor(s): ARCH Venture Partners  \n  - Article (primary): https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paradigm-health-raises-78-million-series-b-to-make-clinical-trials-part-of-routine-care-across-the-us-and-globally-302632924.html  \n  - Round size (from dataset): $78.0M\n\nNotes:\n- Valuation entries for these rounds are not present in the valuations table (closest-matched valuations returned null). If you want, I can (a) search for any non-primary articles or additional press links for each round, (b) pull the article titles/publication names, or (c) try a web lookup for announced valuations (if you want me to attempt deriving valuations from other fields in the dataset). Which would you like?",
