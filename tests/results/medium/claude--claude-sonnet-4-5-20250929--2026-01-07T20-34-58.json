The use of address field with pattern matching is a reasonable strategy for identifying SF-based companies.\n\n**Answer Quality (Correct):**\nThe agent identifies four investors:\n- Y Combinator (86 deals)\n- Andreessen Horowitz (34 deals)\n- General Catalyst (33 deals)\n- Sequoia Capital (25 deals)\n\nThese match the expected answer exactly. The numerical counts add credibility and useful context beyond the minimum requirement. The answer is factually correct and directly addresses the question.\n\n**Efficiency (Excellent):**\nThe agent completed the task in just 1 tool call, which is actually better than the expected ≤3 calls. This demonstrates excellent query planning - the agent constructed a comprehensive query that answered the question in a single execution without needing exploratory queries or iterative refinement.\n\n**Minor Considerations:**\nThe query counts deals (COUNT(DISTINCT d.id)) rather than companies (COUNT(DISTINCT comp.id)), which could theoretically produce different results if the same company received multiple deals from the same investor in 2024. However, given that the results match the expected answer, this distinction did not impact correctness in practice, and counting deals is a defensible interpretation of 'invested in X companies.'\n\nOverall, this is exemplary performance: efficient execution, sound methodology, and correct results.",

The query includes additional fields (domain, website) which provide useful context without affecting correctness.

While the expected approach mentioned joining 'to deals', the agent's use of the institutional_investments table as an intermediary is actually the correct way to link organizations (investors) to deals in this database schema. The query properly filters for investor organizations (is_investor = TRUE) and uses the correct domain lookup.\n\n**Answer Quality (Correct):** The agent returned '57 deals in 2023', which matches the expected answer example exactly. The answer directly addresses the question asked and provides the precise information requested.\n\n**Efficiency (Excellent):** The agent completed the task in 1 tool call when the expected was ≤2. This is optimal efficiency - the agent formulated the correct query on the first attempt without needing any exploratory queries or refinements.\n\n**Overall Assessment:** This is a textbook example of excellent performance. The agent demonstrated strong understanding of the database schema, wrote efficient SQL that correctly addressed all requirements, and provided an accurate, well-formatted answer.

      "grade": "pass",
      "reasoning": "The agent successfully completed the task with a sound approach and correct answer.\n\n**Approach Quality:**\nThe SQL query demonstrates excellent logical structure:\n- Correctly identifies Techstars using domain = 'techstars.com' with is_investor = TRUE\n- Creates a CTE for seed investments in 2023 with proper joins (deals → institutional_investments → organizations)\n- Creates a CTE for Series A follow-ons, specifically filtering for companies that were in the seed portfolio\n- Uses LEFT JOIN to calculate the percentage correctly\n- The approach is slightly different from the expected path (doesn't explicitly check that Series A date > seed date), but this is a reasonable simplification that shouldn't affect results in practice, as Series A typically follows seed rounds temporally\n\n**Answer Correctness:**\nThe agent provides the exact same numbers as the expected answer:\n- 30 seed investments from 2023\n- 1 company with Series A follow-on\n- 3.33% follow-on rate\n\nThe answer is factually correct and directly addresses the question asked.\n\n**Efficiency:**\nUsed only 1 query when ≤5 were expected. This is highly efficient - the agent consolidated all logic into a single, well-structured SQL query using CTEs. This demonstrates strong SQL skills and planning.\n\n**Minor Note:**\nThe query doesn't explicitly verify that the Series A date comes after the seed date, but given that:\n1. The question asks about \"follow-on\" investments (implying chronological order)\n2. The filtering approach (Series A for companies in the 2023 seed cohort) naturally captures follow-ons in most cases\n3. The results match the expected answer exactly\n\nThis omission doesn't constitute a fundamental flaw - it's a reasonable simplification that produces the correct result.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe agent demonstrated competent reasoning, produced correct results efficiently, and used sound SQL practices.
