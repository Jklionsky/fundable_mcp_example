      "reasoning": "The agent followed the expected approach: they queried unique deal IDs with the date in 2024 (used COUNT(DISTINCT d.id) and EXTRACT(YEAR FROM d.date) = 2024), which is a sound and direct method to answer \"how many deals happened in 2024.\" They returned a precise numeric result (16,553) and even noted a sensible caveat (the count includes all deal types such as SECONDARY_MARKET), showing awareness of possible interpretation nuances. Efficiency was good — a single, appropriate tool call and one SQL query (within the ≤2 expectation). Overall the approach, execution, and result are correct and defensible, so the task is passed.",
