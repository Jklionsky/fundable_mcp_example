      "reasoning": "The agent used a direct, sound approach: a single SQL query that counts distinct deal IDs with dates in the 2024 range (d.date >= '2024-01-01' AND d.date < '2025-01-01'), which correctly captures all timestamps in calendar year 2024. They used only one tool call (efficient) and returned a clear numeric result (16,553). The agent also sensibly noted the interpretation — that this counts all financings recorded in the deals table during 2024 (including all financing types and secondary market deals) — which is a defensible interpretation of the question. There are no evident logical errors or inefficiencies, so the task is successfully completed.",
