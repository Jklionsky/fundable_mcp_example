      "grade": "fail",
      "reasoning": "The agent failed to answer the core question regarding funding rounds for 'Paradigm Health'. Its approach was to repeatedly search for the organization itself, but it never progressed to querying for funding deals, articles, or investors, which was the main objective of the task. The agent's queries only focused on finding the organization ID, and it concluded it couldn't find 'Paradigm Health' directly. This indicates a fundamental flaw in its execution pipeline where it got stuck on the initial identification phase. While the number of calls was within the expected range (3 calls, expected <=3), all calls were effectively redundant attempts to find the same initial entity, and none moved towards gathering the requested financial data. The expected approach clearly outlined steps to filter deals and join related tables, none of which were attempted by the agent.",
