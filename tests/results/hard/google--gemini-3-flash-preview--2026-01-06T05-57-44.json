      "reasoning": "The agent failed to provide a final answer to the user's question, ending the process after 9 tool calls without summarizing the findings into a response. Furthermore, the agent was significantly inefficient, using 9 tool calls when the expected amount was 6 or fewer. According to the evaluation criteria, taking more than 2 calls beyond the expected amount is considered a major inefficiency. While the SQL queries generated (particularly Query 9) were logically sound and likely to produce the correct data, the lack of a final synthesized answer and the excessive number of attempts to refine the search parameters constitute a failure to complete the task effectively.",
