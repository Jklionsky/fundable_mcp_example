      "reasoning": "The agent successfully identified the requested companies. It correctly identified 'Deasie' and 'Palla' as companies meeting the criteria (MIT Sloan founder and Y Combinator backing). The agent's logical approach was sound: it searched for the specific investor (YC), searched for the specific education institution (MIT Sloan), and joined them through people/founder associations and deal tables. While the agent used 12 tool calls (exceeding the guideline of 6), the extra queries were used effectively to refine the search when initial exact matches for the education ID were too narrow, eventually using broader string matching on degrees and fields to ensure accuracy. The final answer provided rich context, including the specific founder names and funding details.",

It was founded by **Mikko Peiponen**, who attended the **MIT Sloan School of Management**. Y Combinator is an investor, and the company most recently raised a **$2.9 million Seed round** in October 2023.\n*   **Palla**: An early-stage fintech company operating a platform for real-time international payments in Latin America. It was founded by **Enrique Perezalonso**, who also attended **MIT Sloan**. While Y Combinator invested in their earlier stages, the company has since raised a total of **$14.5 million** and recently moved into its Series A phase.\n\nAnother notable example is **Lively** (an HSA platform), co-founded by **Shobin Uralil** (MIT Sloan), which was backed by Y Combinator in its early stages but has since scaled to a Series C/D level with over $122 million in total funding.",
