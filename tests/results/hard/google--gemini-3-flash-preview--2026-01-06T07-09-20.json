      "reasoning": "The agent followed a logical and efficient path to answer the question. It correctly identified the organization ID for OpenAI, queried for deals and valuations since 2025, and provided a comprehensive list of fundraises and their associated valuations. The agent used 4 tool calls, which is exactly within the expected limit. The answer provided matches the expected data points (March, August, and October deals) and provides additional context for December 2025 that was found in the database. The approach was sound, and the final answer is correct and well-structured.",
