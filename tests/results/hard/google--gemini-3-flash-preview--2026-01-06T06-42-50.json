      "reasoning": "The agent followed a very logical and systematic approach. It first identified the correct IDs for MIT Sloan and Y Combinator, then constructed increasingly sophisticated SQL queries to join education data with funding data and organizational roles. The agent correctly handled the nuances of identifying founders (checking both the boolean flag and titles) and defining seed rounds (including SAFE). The final answer provided exactly what was requested, matching the expected example, and did so within the expected number of tool calls.",
