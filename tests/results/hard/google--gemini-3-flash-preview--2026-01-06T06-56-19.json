      "question": "Find company with most secondary market transactions and show which investors bought secondary shares",
      "grade": "pass",
      "reasoning": "The agent successfully identified OpenAI as the company with the most secondary market transactions (3 deals) and correctly listed the investors involved in those transactions. The logical approach was sound: first identifying the top company, then querying for the specific details of that company's secondary deals. While the agent took 3 tool calls (one more than the 'expected' target of 2), this is well within the acceptable efficiency range (+2 calls over expected is the threshold for a major inefficiency). The final answer was detailed, accurate, and aligned perfectly with the expected results.",

      "answer": "The company with the most secondary market transactions in the dataset is **OpenAI**, with a total of **3 secondary deals**.\n\nThe investors who have purchased secondary shares in OpenAI across these transactions include:\n\n*   **Recent Large Transaction:**\n    *   MGX\n    *   T.
