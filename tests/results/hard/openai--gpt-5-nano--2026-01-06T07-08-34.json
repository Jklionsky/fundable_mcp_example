      "question": "what is openais valuation since start of 2025: for each fundraise what was their valuation",
      "grade": "pass",
      "reasoning": "Assessment of the agent's performance: \n\n- Logical approach: The agent followed a solid, defensible method. It targeted OpenAI (non-investor) records from 2025-01-01 onward and joined deals with valuations, using the earliest valuation date on or after each fundraise to represent the post-money valuation. This aligns with the expected approach of deriving valuation history tied to each round. The use of three queries (within the ≤4 limit) is appropriate and efficient for the task.\n\n- Answer quality: The agent provided a clear, chronological list of fundraises with per-round post-money valuations, including currency framing (millions USD) and noting when a valuation is unavailable. The rounds shown (2025-03-31, 2025-08-01, 2025-10-02, 2025-12-11, 2026-01-04) cover the requested timeframe and exhibit the expected format (date, raise amount, post-money valuation). There is a minor inconsistency in the prose note stating that the December 2025 raise lacked a valuation, while the bullet list actually includes a valuation for that round; this is a small editorial error, not a fundamental flaw in the data extraction. Overall, the core data (rounds and valuations) is present and coherent.\n\n- Completeness and scope: The answer includes multiple rounds within 2025 and at least one round in early 2026, which is consistent with “since start of 2025.” It also clearly marks a case where valuation data is missing (for 2026-01-04), maintaining transparency about data availability.\n\n- Efficiency: The task was completed with 3 queries, which is within the expected limit, indicating efficient use of tooling.\n\n- Suggestions for improvement: If desired, provide a machine-readable export (CSV/JSON) and add explicit note on currency/valuation type (post-money vs. pre-money) for each round, and ensure internal consistency in narrative notes to avoid contradictions.\n",

      "answer": "Here’s what the Fundable dataset shows for OpenAI’s fundraising since 2025-01-01, with post-money valuations per round. All monetary values are in millions of USD (USD millions).\n\n- 2025-03-31 — Equity round\n  - Raised: 40,000 million (i.e., about $40.0B)\n  - Post-money valuation: 300,000 million (i.e., about $300.0B)\n\n- 2025-08-01 — Equity round\n  - Raised: 8,300 million (~$8.3B)\n  - Post-money valuation: 300,000 million (~$300.0B)\n\n- 2025-10-02 — Secondary market round\n  - Raised: 6,600 million (~$6.6B)\n  - Post-money valuation: 500,000 million (~$500.0B)\n\n- 2025-12-11 — Equity round\n  - Raised: 1,000 million ($1.0B)\n  - Post-money valuation: 260,000 million (~$260.0B)\n\n- 2026-01-04 — Equity round\n  - Raised: 40,000 million ($40.0B)\n  - Post-money valuation: not recorded in the dataset (null)\n\nNotes:\n- The data is presented in millions of USD, as per the dataset's business rules.\n- The valuations shown are sourced from the valuations table, using the earliest valuation date on or after each fundraise (i.e., post-money valuation associated with that round when available).\n- If you’d like, I can also provide a CSV/JSON export, or expand to show pre-money valuations if available, or include currency/valuation type details per round.",
