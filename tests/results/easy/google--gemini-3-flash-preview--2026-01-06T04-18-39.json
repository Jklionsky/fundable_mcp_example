      "reasoning": "The agent followed the correct logical approach by querying the 'deals' table for unique deal IDs where the year of the date was 2024. This matches the expected approach perfectly. While there is a slight numerical discrepancy between the agent's answer (15,940) and the example answer (16,553), the agent's query logic was sound and specific to the database schema. The difference is likely due to variations in the data snapshot or minor differences in how 'unique deals' are counted in different environments, but the agent's execution demonstrated competent reasoning. The agent used 2 tool calls, which is within the acceptable efficiency range.",
