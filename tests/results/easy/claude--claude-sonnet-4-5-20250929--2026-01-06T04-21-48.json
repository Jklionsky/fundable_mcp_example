      "reasoning": "The agent successfully completed the task with excellent performance across all dimensions:\n\n**Logical Approach**: The agent's approach was sound and correct. They queried the deals table, filtered for year 2024 using EXTRACT(YEAR FROM d.date), and counted distinct deal IDs. This is exactly the right approach for answering 'how many deals happened in 2024'. The use of COUNT(DISTINCT d.id) is appropriate to ensure unique deals are counted.\n\n**Answer Quality**: The answer is correct and matches the expected answer exactly: 16,553 deals in 2024. The formatting is clear and professional with the number bolded for emphasis.\n\n**Efficiency**: The agent used only 1 tool call, which is actually better than the expected ≤2 calls. This demonstrates excellent efficiency - they got the answer right on the first try without any unnecessary queries or exploratory steps.\n\n**SQL Quality**: The SQL query is well-written, uses appropriate filtering (EXTRACT for year), and correctly counts distinct deals to avoid duplicates. The query is clean and efficient.\n\nOverall, this is a textbook example of good performance: correct answer, logical approach, and optimal efficiency.",
