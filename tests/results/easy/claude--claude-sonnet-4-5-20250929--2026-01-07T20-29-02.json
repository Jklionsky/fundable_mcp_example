      "grade": "pass",
      "reasoning": "The agent successfully completed the task with a sound approach and accurate answer.\n\n**Approach Quality (Strong):**\nThe agent took a logical three-step approach:\n1. Query 1: Identified founders of Radiant by looking up organization_associations with is_founder=TRUE - correctly found Doug Bernauer and Bob Urberger\n2. Query 2: Attempted to find work history before Radiant using a sophisticated subquery to filter positions that ended before their Radiant start date\n3. Query 3: When Query 2 likely returned incomplete results, pivoted to retrieve all LinkedIn positions for both founders and let the context help determine what was \"before\" Radiant\n\nThis approach aligns with the expected methodology (use organization_associations to find founders, then pull linkedin_positions for work history). The agent showed good problem-solving by adjusting the query strategy when needed.\n\n**Answer Quality (Correct):**\nThe answer provides accurate, relevant information:\n- Doug Bernauer: Correctly identified his work at SpaceX (2008-2019) and Rockwell Automation (2006-2008) with detailed titles and descriptions\n- Bob Urberger: Transparently acknowledged that work history wasn't available but provided his LinkedIn URL\n- The answer matches the expected answer format, naming both co-founders and their prior work experience\n- Added valuable context about how Doug's SpaceX experience relates to Radiant's mission\n\n**Efficiency (Acceptable):**\nUsed 3 tool calls against an expected ≤4. This is well within acceptable range. The progression shows intentional refinement rather than wasteful redundancy:\n- Query 1 was necessary for founder discovery\n- Query 2 was a reasonable attempt with sophisticated filtering logic\n- Query 3 was a tactical adjustment to ensure complete data retrieval\n\nNo queries were wasted or duplicative - each served a clear purpose in the discovery process.\n\n**Minor Notes:**\n- Bob Urberger's missing work history is a data limitation, not an agent failure\n- The agent handled this limitation transparently and professionally\n- The question \"what did founders do beforehand\" was answered for at least one founder with comprehensive detail\n\nOverall: The agent demonstrated competent database querying, logical problem-solving, and provided a factually correct, useful answer within reasonable efficiency bounds.",
