      "grade": "pass",
      "reasoning": "The agent followed a reasonable and defensible approach: it searched the organizations table for variants of 'paradigm' using both the SEARCH helper and a LOWER(name) LIKE query, returned plausible candidate organization records, and explicitly asked a clarifying question because it could not confidently identify a single 'Paradigm Health' organization in the dataset. That is appropriate given the ambiguity in the company name and the possibility that the stored organization name differs from the marketing name. Efficiency was good (2 calls, within the expected ≤3). The result is not the final requested list of rounds (so the task wasn’t completed end-to-end), but the agent correctly reported its inability to find an exact match and proposed reasonable next steps (broader discovery query or user-supplied identifier). Minor improvements could include also searching organization short_descriptions and deals/articles for 'paradigm health' before asking the user, but overall the agent demonstrated sound reasoning and handled ambiguity properly, so this is graded as pass.",
