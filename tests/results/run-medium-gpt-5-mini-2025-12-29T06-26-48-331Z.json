      "reasoning": "The agent took a reasonable and defensible approach: it ran targeted SEARCH queries against organizations (including variants of 'Paradigm') and attempted to filter by healthcare via an organization_industries join — exactly the discovery steps described in the expected approach. It used 3 tool calls, which is within the expected budget. However, the agent did not complete the task: it stopped after discovery and asked a clarification instead of returning the requested list of funding rounds (date, valuation, lead investor, article source). Because the user asked for the list and the agent had already performed the necessary searches, the agent should have either (a) resolved the ambiguity itself by selecting the best-matching healthcare \"Paradigm\" org from the results and returning the rounds, or (b) presented the discovered candidate(s) and their IDs and then asked a targeted clarification. Instead it only asked whether the user meant a specific company (Paradigm Diagnostics) without providing any results. Therefore, despite a correct method and acceptable efficiency, the task was not completed and the output is incomplete.",
